# Virgo Voice Assistant (Python)

### This project demonstrates how to combine multiple approaches by integrating local tools and commercial APIs into a unified voice assistant.



An intelligent voice assistant powered by:
- Real-time hotword detection using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)
- Smart AI replies via [Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/)
- Speech recognition & text-to-speech by [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
- Fully functional on Linux using FFmpeg and Python

---

## Features

- Say "Virgo" to activate
- Records your voice until you stop speaking (max within 15 sec or silence detected)
- Transcribes your voice using ElevenLabs STT
- Sends it to Gemini AI for a reply
- Speaks the response back with ElevenLabs TTS

### 3. Download a Vosk model

You need to download the English model and extract it into a folder named `model/`:

```bash
wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
mv vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 model
